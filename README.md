# Climate finance: Global Carbon Arbitrage

This work is part of broader update efforts for a previous report on climate financing.

## Structure:

- Script 1 --- identifies emissions intensity factors for fossil fuel power & extraction sectors. This data provides global power & extraction plant level emissions & production details.
  
- Script 2 --- converts outputs from NGFS scenarios into emissions and compares them to global carbon budgets.
  
- Script 3 --- uses NGFS projections' growth rates and applies them to current actual plant level data to adjust projected emissions.
  
- Script 4 --- since NGFS pathways are not entirely aligned with global carbon budgets, this identifies 'reduction factors' required to increase pace of phase-out.
  
- Script 5 --- is a case study for Poland.

**3. Modified Net Zero 2050 scenario**: This scenario is modified to align global emissions path with global carbon budget for 1.5Â°C with 50% warming limiting likelyhood.
